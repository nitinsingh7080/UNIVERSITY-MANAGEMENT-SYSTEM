University Management System: Full Description--:

The University Management System (UMS) is a web-based application designed to manage various operations of a university. It provides tools for administrators, faculty, and students to manage academic and administrative activities efficiently. The system leverages Java, Servlets, JSP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL to create a robust, interactive, and scalable platform.

Technologies Used
1. Backend
Java & Servlets: Core logic for request handling and data processing.
JSP (Java Server Pages): Dynamic web page rendering.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Database connectivity to execute SQL queries.
2. Frontend
HTML: Structure of web pages.
CSS: Styling for a professional and responsive design.
JavaScript: Interactive elements (e.g., form validation, AJAX for dynamic updates).
Bootstrap: Responsive and mobile-first design framework.
3. Database
MySQL: Stores user data, course information, grades, and attendance records.
4. Server
Apache Tomcat: Servlet container for deploying the web application.
System Architecture
1. Three-Tier Architecture
Presentation Layer (Frontend):
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
AJAX for asynchronous requests.
Business Logic Layer (Backend):
Java Servlets and JSP handle the application logic.
Database Layer:
MySQL database stores and retrieves data for the application.
2. Workflow
User Request: A user sends a request (e.g., viewing grades).
Servlet Processing: The servlet receives the request, processes it, and interacts with the database.
Database Query: SQL queries fetch or update data.
Response Generation: JSP renders the dynamic page and sends it back to the user.
Database Design
